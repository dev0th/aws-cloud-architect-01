Recover Time Objective (RTO) is the maximum time your platform or service can be unavailable
Recovery Point Objective (RPO) is the maximum amount of time that your system can lose data for

1. Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage
- Problem happens (1 min)
- An amount of time passes before an alert triggers (4 min)
- Automatically switch to second availability zone (5 min)
Estimated minimum RTO for a single AZ outage: ~10 min

2. Minimum RTO for a single region outage
- Time to bring read replica as a standalone primary instance takes around 15-20 minutes
- Time to apply new DNS changes in application to connect to new endpoint can take anywhere from 15-120 minutes
Estimated minimum RTO for a single region outage about 15-60 min

3. Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage
- Application continues to run and serve a request for 60-120 sec but is failing to store the data it receives
Estimated minimum RTO for a single region outage: 2 min

4. Minimum RPO for a single region outage
- Database is updated asynchronously between Primary and read replica in Multi-AZ, Multi-region mode
- Initial setup and installation time, it takes minimum 15-20 minutes for system to get ready
Estimated minimum RPO for a single region outage: ~15 min
